# React Native UI transitions
React Native UI transitions created using the React Native Animations and React Native Reanimated Library.
One is along the lines of the Music Player sliding animation used in the Apple Music app, the other is a clone of the animation used in the Uber login page.
2 seperate branches created for each animation.
